00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,665
So now that our code has worked,

2
00:00:01,665 --> 00:00:05,010
let's figure out what's actually going on with this program.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:09,090
Now, the first thing that strikes me is this first line of code which

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:14,785
is from twilio.rest import TwilioRestClient.

5
00:00:14,785 --> 00:00:17,670
Now thus far, what we've been doing is statements like

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,351
this where we say, import some filename.

7
00:00:21,351 --> 00:00:24,100
Like in this case import turtle,

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:29,353
but here we have this new word called from.

9
00:00:29,353 --> 00:00:31,515
So here's the task for you.

10
00:00:31,515 --> 00:00:35,841
We want you to find out what this Python keyword from means?

00:00:35,841 --> 00:00:39,000
