00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,815
Okay. So, here is our program design.

2
00:00:02,815 --> 00:00:06,575
I'm going to start by opening a browser and playing a song.

3
00:00:06,575 --> 00:00:11,570
So previously, I Googled to find out how one would open a web browser in Python.

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:16,470
And I discovered that there is this function called webbrowser.open.

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,165
This function takes in the link I want to open.

6
00:00:20,165 --> 00:00:22,190
I just pasted a YouTube address in there.

7
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,830
In fact, this could have been any link you want. All right.

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,985
Let's save the program and run it.

9
00:00:27,985 --> 00:00:30,510
I'm going to call it breaktime.py.

10
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,370
Py stands for Python.

11
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,875
To run it, I will click on run,

12
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:37,285
and then click on run module.

13
00:00:37,285 --> 00:00:40,080
Now my hypothesis is that when we run this program,

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,940
it will open the YouTube link. Let's see.

15
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,670
Oh, it seems like we have an error.

16
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:50,630
Okay. It says, "There's an error in your program: EOL," whatever that means,

17
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,905
"while scanning the string literal."

18
00:00:52,905 --> 00:00:57,180
Okay. Oh, look, Python is pointing at the error.

19
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,240
It seems like I missed the closing quote.

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,055
So I'm going to add that.

21
00:01:02,055 --> 00:01:04,985
Let me save the program one more time and run it.

22
00:01:04,985 --> 00:01:09,240
Now, I believe it will work. Another error.

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,030
When I first learned how to program,

24
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,630
I felt so intimidated by these errors. Look at them.

25
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,925
They are red and in your face,

26
00:01:17,925 --> 00:01:19,680
but to make the program work,

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,860
we have to somehow get past them.

28
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,510
So, would you mind reading the error and telling us

29
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,260
what you think is the problem with this code?

30
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,090
