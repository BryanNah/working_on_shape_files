00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,035
So now that we've played Avatar's movie trailer, here's your challenge.

2
00:00:04,035 --> 00:00:06,065
I want you to comment out this line.

3
00:00:06,065 --> 00:00:08,335
The line that shows the trailer for Avatar.

4
00:00:08,335 --> 00:00:11,293
Then, I want you to create a new object.

5
00:00:11,293 --> 00:00:13,465
But this time of your favorite movie.

6
00:00:13,465 --> 00:00:16,530
And I want you to play each trailer instead.

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,525
Here are the instructions one more time.

8
00:00:18,525 --> 00:00:20,825
Much like Toy Story in Avatar,

9
00:00:20,825 --> 00:00:24,480
we want you to create a new instance or object of the class movie.

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,570
Once you've done that, we want you to play a trailer of that movie,

11
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,605
using the new instance or object.

12
00:00:29,605 --> 00:00:31,575
And finally, we want you to share

13
00:00:31,575 --> 00:00:35,285
a screenshot of your program's output on the discussion forum.

14
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:39,060
Now, in case you have a way to video record your computer screen?

15
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,770
Perhaps using a smartphone,

16
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,540
you can also share a YouTube video of your output with us.

17
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,000
Make sure to check this box after submitting your response on the photo.
