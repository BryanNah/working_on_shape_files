Congratulations on finishing another project.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,215
Here is your assignment.

3
00:00:04,215 --> 00:00:07,955
Now that we've seen classes in two different projects, for instance,

4
00:00:07,955 --> 00:00:09,870
with total and twill your rest client,

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,135
we want you to answer the following questions on that discussion forum.

6
00:00:14,135 --> 00:00:17,050
The first question is, what is a class?

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,400
The next one is, what is an instance of a class?

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,140
And finally, thus far,

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,365
we have compared a class to a blueprint.

10
00:00:24,365 --> 00:00:27,685
Can you think of another analogy to explain classes?

11
00:00:27,685 --> 00:00:31,270
