1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
Okay. So, here's the code for class parent.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:07,120
And now, I will start to define class child.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:12,030
Now, I know class child inherits from class parent,

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,315
and the way to indicate that in Python is to say this.

5
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:20,550
The syntax here means that class child will now

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,965
inherit or reuse everything that is publicly available in class parent.

7
00:00:24,965 --> 00:00:28,220
Now, things will get really interesting when we begin to

8
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,520
define the _init_ method or the constructor for this class.

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,240
So, we know that class child has

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,630
three variables: last name and eye color that are inherited from class parent,

11
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,120
and there is other variable called "number of toys."

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,900
So, in addition to the keyword "self," I will receive those values

13
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,980
as arguments right here in the _init_ function, there they are.

14
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:53,330
Now, to initialize the variables I'm inheriting from class parent,

15
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,705
variables like last name and eye color,

16
00:00:55,705 --> 00:01:01,510
I will actually reuse class parents _init_ method. This is how to do it.

17
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,960
The last instance variable,

18
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,480
number of toys, will be initialized next.

19
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:25,900
Okay. Finally, I will add a print statement to the very beginning of the _init_ method.

20
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:36,585
All right. Now, that we have defined our class child,

21
00:01:36,585 --> 00:01:40,435
the next thing to do is to create an instance of this class child.

22
00:01:40,435 --> 00:01:45,490
I will call it appropriately enough Miley Cyrus, and here,

23
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,395
I will provide the three necessary arguments,

24
00:01:48,395 --> 00:01:51,440
and then I will print out two things,

25
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,565
her last name and the number of toys.

26
00:01:55,565 --> 00:01:59,580
Also, so I can focus on these print statements in my output,

27
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,720
I will comment out the previous instance for now.

28
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,140
There. Let me save this file.

29
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,665
Now, before I run this program,

30
00:02:08,665 --> 00:02:11,680
I want you to think about what the output of this program will be.

31
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,110
So, here is the code one more time,

32
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,440
here is class parent,

33
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,985
and here's class child.

34
00:02:16,985 --> 00:02:19,810
And here, we are creating an instance of class child,

35
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,250
and we named it Miley Cyrus.

36
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,850
So, what do you think will be printed when I run this piece of code?

37
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:28,140
