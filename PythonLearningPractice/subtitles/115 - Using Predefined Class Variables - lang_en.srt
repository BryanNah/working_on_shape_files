1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
So, now that we know a little bit about class variables,

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,805
let's move on to another idea in object-oriented programming,

3
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:07,640
which is that in Python,

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,115
all classes come with some pre-existing class variables.

5
00:00:11,115 --> 00:00:13,680
One of them is called "doc."

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,495
Now, this variable has got underscores on both sides of its name.

7
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:19,310
Let's see this variable in action.

8
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,235
So, here I am at the Python Shell window with the Python prompt,

9
00:00:23,235 --> 00:00:25,990
and I can type a program in here like 2 plus 2,

10
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,725
and it gives me the correct answer.

11
00:00:27,725 --> 00:00:30,685
Now, I want us to recall this class called

12
00:00:30,685 --> 00:00:34,120
Turtle that we had used some time back while drawing shapes,

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,845
so I can just import that class Turtle here.

14
00:00:36,845 --> 00:00:42,870
There. Then, let me see what happens when I use the class name turtle.Turtle.

15
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,850
Remember, this was the name of the module or the file,

16
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,470
and this was the class name.

17
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:54,090
So if I use the class name with the pre-packaged variable called doc,

18
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,755
let me see what it prints out.

19
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:59,985
Aha! I get some documentation on the class Turtle.

20
00:00:59,985 --> 00:01:04,685
Now, I wonder if I can use this variable doc with my class Movie.

21
00:01:04,685 --> 00:01:07,340
So I'm back to the code for the class Movie,

22
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,860
and behind this file is my other Python file

23
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,870
where I'm defining a whole bunch of instances of class Movie.

24
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,970
Let me go back to the code for class Movie here for a second.

25
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:21,220
Now here, I'm going to add some documentation at the beginning of the class Movie.

26
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,440
You may have noticed that I used triple quotes to define my documentation.

27
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,865
Now, what I can do with triple quotes is I can create documentation in multiple lines.

28
00:01:29,865 --> 00:01:31,590
For now, I just have the one line.

29
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,980
So I'm going to save this file and then go to my other Python file.

30
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:44,555
Here, I'm going to scroll all the way to the bottom and comment out any print statements.

31
00:01:44,555 --> 00:01:48,855
There. Now, I will try to print out my class Movie,

32
00:01:48,855 --> 00:01:52,320
which is accessed by saying media.Movie.

33
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,260
I will try to print out its documentation.

34
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,430
There.

35
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,170
Let me save and run this file.

36
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,260
There it is, the documentation for my class Movie.

37
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,860
Notice how I accessed it, though.

38
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,965
I accessed it using my class name,

39
00:02:09,965 --> 00:02:13,795
which is Movie, and a predefined class variable called doc.

40
00:02:13,795 --> 00:02:17,630
So, now that we have successfully use this variable called doc,

41
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,375
I have a question for you.

42
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,745
Much like the variable doc,

43
00:02:21,745 --> 00:02:24,805
Python has a few more predefined variables.

44
00:02:24,805 --> 00:02:28,055
These include the variable name and module.

45
00:02:28,055 --> 00:02:30,425
By the way, more information about these

46
00:02:30,425 --> 00:02:32,970
is also available through links in the instructor notes.

47
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:37,070
What I want you to do is read through the documentation in the instructor notes,

48
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:41,565
and then I want you to use these variables name and module in a new program.

49
00:02:41,565 --> 00:02:45,640
Once you've done that, please come back to the screen and check this box.
