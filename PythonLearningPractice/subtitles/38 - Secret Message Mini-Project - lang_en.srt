00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,270
So here's your mini project.

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:07,770
We want you to create your very own secret message for a friend or a loved one.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,230
Now, the secret message could be anything from you wishing them a great day,

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,930
to you telling them how happy you are to have them in your life.

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,955
You can start by showing them the jumbled-up version of your message.

6
00:00:19,955 --> 00:00:24,285
Now, we've provided some images of the alphabet in the instructor notes.

7
00:00:24,285 --> 00:00:25,980
You can use them if you'd like.

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,625
Then run the program and reveal your secret message to your friend.

9
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:33,200
Your assignment is to share videos or

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,245
photos of your friends' reaction with us on the discussion forum.

11
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:40,290
Once you're done, check this box before you continue.
