00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,860
Okay, so to share videos and photos,

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,130
I will click on that discussion thread with a star.

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:12,225
Now the star means that I created this thread for you to submit your responses.

4
00:00:12,225 --> 00:00:14,130
Once the discussion forum has opened,

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,850
you can simply scroll down and add a YouTube link right here to the discussions.

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,110
You will notice that there is a YouTube video that is

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,680
embedded right within the discussion forum.

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,933
There.

9
00:00:27,933 --> 00:00:31,370
Now, let's talk about how to upload a photo.

10
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,960
To do that, I will click on

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,080
this tiny photo icon and then simply upload a photo from my computer.

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,490
That's the one I want to upload.

13
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:46,575
And you will notice that much like the YouTube video,

14
00:00:46,575 --> 00:00:51,060
the photo is also uploaded right here within the discussion forums.

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,405
Let me hit submit and done.

16
00:00:54,405 --> 00:00:57,280
So, here, I am back to the mini project,

17
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,340
which is for you to teach the program that we

18
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,980
have written together to a friend or a colleague.

19
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,460
We also want you to use your smartphone to record a video of

20
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,670
your conversation and then share that YouTube video with us on the discussion forum.

21
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,940
Oh, by the way, if you are unable to record a video,

22
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,080
we would love to see some photos or

23
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,510
some text describing your conversation with your friend.

24
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,320
After you have submitted your responses on the forum,

25
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,000
make sure you check this box.
