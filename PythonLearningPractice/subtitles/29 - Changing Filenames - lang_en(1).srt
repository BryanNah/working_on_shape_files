1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,985
Okay, let's do Step 2 now,

2
00:00:01,985 --> 00:00:04,050
which is to rename files.

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:10,640
Now, I provided the link to the documentation for the module OS in the instructor notes.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,200
I want you to scan that documentation and

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,870
find out which function we can use to rename files.

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:22,165
By the way, this sort of a search is done quite commonly by software engineers.

7
00:00:22,165 --> 00:00:23,760
Once you've found that function,

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,400
enter the name of that function in the box provided.
