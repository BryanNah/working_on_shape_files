00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,045
Now, before we write the second part of this program,

2
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:06,325
I want you to experiment with built-in functions.

3
00:00:06,325 --> 00:00:10,410
Pick any one of the built-in functions or read through their documentation.

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,700
By the way, the link to this page is available in the instructor notes.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,985
Use your chosen built-in functions in a new program.

6
00:00:17,985 --> 00:00:20,630
And then, share your experiences on the forum.

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,305
You should answer questions like,

8
00:00:22,305 --> 00:00:26,135
which built-in function did you actually decide to use?

9
00:00:26,135 --> 00:00:27,925
What did your program do?

10
00:00:27,925 --> 00:00:30,525
And what problems did you run into?

11
00:00:30,525 --> 00:00:34,005
By the way, being able to read documentation and

12
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:38,745
experimenting with Python is a big part of learning how to program.

13
00:00:38,745 --> 00:00:41,145
Once you've posted your responses on the forum,

14
00:00:41,145 --> 00:00:44,000
feel free to check this box before you continue.
