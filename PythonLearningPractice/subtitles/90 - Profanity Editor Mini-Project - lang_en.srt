00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,050
So now that we have finished designing our project, here's your assignment.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:08,520
We want you to show the program we've written together to a friend or colleague.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,675
Now, you can continue to use the profanity editor website,

4
00:00:11,675 --> 00:00:15,150
which is wdyl.com, or

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,285
you can use some sort of a different internet service, like Pirate speech.

6
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:22,565
By the way, the link to this is available in the instructor notes.

7
00:00:22,565 --> 00:00:24,290
While you are doing that,

8
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,190
we want you to use your smartphone to

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,250
record a video of the conversation with your friend or colleague.

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,140
And then, we want you to share your YouTube video with us on the discussion forum.

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,000
Make sure you check this box after submitting your responses on the forum.
