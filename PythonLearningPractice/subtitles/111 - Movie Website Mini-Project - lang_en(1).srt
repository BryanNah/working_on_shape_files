00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,085
So let me start this video by saying that in case this code did not work for you,

2
00:00:05,085 --> 00:00:08,915
ask us questions on the discussion forum. We are here to help.

3
00:00:08,915 --> 00:00:13,155
Now, you may be curious about this file called fresh_tomatoes.

4
00:00:13,155 --> 00:00:15,450
So let's talk about it next.

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,255
Now, I want you to recall that this file

6
00:00:18,255 --> 00:00:23,215
fresh_tomatoes.py had a function inside it called open_movies_page.

7
00:00:23,215 --> 00:00:26,160
Now this function receives a list of movies,

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,770
and then creates and opens an HTML file or a webpage that showcases those movies.

9
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,770
By the way, it stores this HTML file in

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,785
the exact same folder as all of your other movie program files.

11
00:00:38,785 --> 00:00:40,675
So let me go to that folder now.

12
00:00:40,675 --> 00:00:45,925
And here is my movies folder with all of my python movie files right here.

13
00:00:45,925 --> 00:00:50,995
Notice that this is the HTML file that we just created by running our program.

14
00:00:50,995 --> 00:00:56,005
This is the file that actually showed us all of our movies and played the trailer.

15
00:00:56,005 --> 00:01:01,010
And here is the fresh_tomatoes python file that you downloaded from our website.

16
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,200
Let me open it. All right,

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,220
here is the code for our python file, fresh_tomatoes.py.

18
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,760
Now, while I won't go through this entire code in detail,

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,915
I encourage you to read through this program.

20
00:01:13,915 --> 00:01:16,590
I want you to understand how it takes in a list of

21
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,260
movies and creates a website to show those movies.

22
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,370
Now, we've added comments to this file that will make this code readable.

23
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,790
All right. The next thing we want to do is we

24
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,270
want you to share the movie website that you've created thus far.

25
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,795
So here is your task.

26
00:01:31,795 --> 00:01:36,400
We want you to create your very own movie website with your favorite movies.

27
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,445
Once you've done that, we want you to share

28
00:01:38,445 --> 00:01:41,560
any one of the following two things with us on the forum.

29
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,830
You can take a screenshot or an image of

30
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,260
your movie website and share that with us on the forum,

31
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,990
or if you have access to a smartphone,

32
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,180
we want you to record and share

33
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,125
a YouTube video of you showing your movie website to a friend.

34
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:57,560
Once you've submitted your responses on the forum,

35
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,180
make sure you check this box.
