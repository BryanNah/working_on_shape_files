1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,890
It is a day as ordinary as the next.

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,580
Jenny wakes up and decides to go for a hike.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,735
On this day, however,

4
00:00:09,735 --> 00:00:13,525
she goes down a path she wouldn't normally take.

5
00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:17,500
Before long, an unsettling feeling of being

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,285
lost sets in and she comes to a fork in the road.

7
00:00:22,285 --> 00:00:24,840
Which way to go?

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,065
Only her trusted diary can answer this question.

9
00:00:29,065 --> 00:00:32,945
She opens it and there lies the answer.

10
00:00:32,945 --> 00:00:35,990
A message, it says,

11
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,120
take the road less traveled.

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,985
Now it's up to you to help Jenny get home.

13
00:00:42,985 --> 00:00:46,470
All you have to do is read this piece of code,

14
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,125
which guides the next step she will take.

15
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:54,190
Now tell me, which path will you send Jenny down?
