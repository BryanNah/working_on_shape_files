00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,868
Okay, so we're back to the code.

2
00:00:01,868 --> 00:00:06,200
And all I've done is added the translate function to our program.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,130
So what this code is doing now is saying,

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,195
for each file or for each photo inside our folder, rename it.

5
00:00:13,195 --> 00:00:15,187
Here's the old file name,

6
00:00:15,187 --> 00:00:18,690
and here's the new file name devoid of any numbers.

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,080
Now my hypothesis is that if I save and run this program,

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,235
all of the photo files will be renamed and we'll see the secret message.

9
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:27,370
So let me go ahead and save it,

10
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:33,210
and run the program. Oh, wow.

11
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,395
That clearly did not work.

12
00:00:35,395 --> 00:00:39,750
Would you mind reading through this error and telling us what you think is the problem?

13
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,145
Once you have a hypothesis,

14
00:00:41,145 --> 00:00:43,080
feel free to enter it in the box provided.
